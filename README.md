# 1. Convolution

To find out the output by providing weightage to its indivdual inputs.

# 2. Kernels

An operator to extract a particular feaure of the input

# 3 Epochs

Each iteration of passing entire dataset through a CNN model and back propagating the output to check for the accuracy

# 4 1x1 Convolution

To combine all the features of a prticular pixel and seperating it into a new set of features

# 5 3x3 Convolution

To sum up 3x3 region of a layer by providing a particular weight to each input

# 6 Feature Map

Extracing similar features with the help of kernel and grouping it in a single layer

# 7 Activation Function


# 8 Receptive field
Region of the input layer that is used to calculate a particular pixel of the output layer
